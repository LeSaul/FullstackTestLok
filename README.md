Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Create a MySQL Database 
- Edit the .env file with your database connection
- in the project folder run ```composer install```
- run the migrations and seed the database running the command ```php artisan migrate --seed```
- in the project folder run ```npm install && npm run dev```
- start the server with ```php artisan serve```
